This Haylde post just came in: https://vanguard.haydle.com/questions/7775

I think it’s a reasonable request to try, but only if it
yields really significant time savings.  In general I think headless
testing is a horrible idea, but Josh’s build in particular keeps running into
build time issues taking over 3 hours.  As I mention in the ticket this
seems like addressing the symptom rather than the real issue, but I suppose
it’s something we can try to implement.

 

If you can focus on this today, you should be able to finish
the implementation by EOD.  

Here’s an example from SauceLabs (in python): https://support.saucelabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007848068-Headless-Browser-Testing-with-Chrome-and-Sauce-Labs

And from the Haydle post, we need to set up a ChromeOptions
object and pass “--headless”.

 

Please try this out in the new base-framework branch I
created and got working yesterday: http://prdsvnrepo:8080/svn/shared/projects/selenium-base-framework/branches/0.0.1

You’ll probably want to copy the ChromeConfiguration class
creating a ChromeHeadlessConfiguration.  You can view the DriverFactory
class getChromeDriver() method for an example where we use ChromeOptions
already.  You’ll also have to update the BrowserType for a CHROME_HEADLESS type from
cases “Chrome-headless” or “Chrome_headless”, and the EnvironmentConfigurationFactory
to add an entry for that new CHROME_HEADLESS type.
